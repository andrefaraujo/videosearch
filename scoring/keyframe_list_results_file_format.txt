This is a file format that may be more natural for one to use when having their 
retrieval system write results to file, instead of writing results following the
scene_retrieval_results_file_format.txt rules or the temporal_refinement_results_file_format.txt
rules.

File format conversion scripts have been provided to take a results file following
this keyframe-list format and produce a new results file following the file format
for scene retrieval/temporal refinement that can be used as input to the 
evaluation scripts.

The keyframe-list file format is as follows:
Query <#>
<Keyframe Path>
<Keyframe Path>
<Keyframe Path>
<Keyframe Path>
<Keyframe Path>
..etc..
Query <#>
<Keyframe Path>
<Keyframe Path>
<Keyframe Path>
<Keyframe Path>
<Keyframe Path>
..etc..
...repeat...



<Keyframe Path>'s follow the following format:
<date>/<segment_title>/<scene>_keyframes/<keyframe number>.jpg
e.g.: 20121002/PBS_News_Hour_20121002_1900_cc_segment/01.700k_keyframes/000001.jpg


See example_keyframe_list_results_for_scene_retrieval.txt and 
example_keyframe_list_results_for_temporal_refinement.txt, both of which were 
used as input into the convertKeyframeResultsTo* scripts to create
example_scene_retrieval_results_file.txt and example_temporal_refinement_results_file_frames.txt,
respectively.
